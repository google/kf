## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to `kf-security@google.com`. Vulnerabilities will be
reviewed within two business days and you'll get an email back.

If a vulnerability is accepted, we'll work with you to establish an
appropriate fix and disclosure timeline depending on the severity of the issue,
affected components, and exploitability.

If a vulnerability is rejected, we'll help you open bugs to update
documentation and code to prevent future confusion.
