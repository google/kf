This example broker is a golang implementation of the CATS broker
[developed here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/cli-acceptance-tests/blob/master/gats/assets/service_broker/README.md).

It allows Kf to run exhaustive e2e tests against a simulated broker
without needing to wait for real resources to be provisioned/bound.
