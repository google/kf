  ##########################
  # This ConfigMap serves only as an example. It is named with the "-example"
  # suffix so that we don't accidently stomp on ourselves with something like
  # `ko apply`.
  #
  # Ideally, `kf install` is used to setup the config map. However this
  # example can be used to manually setup a ConfigMap.
  #
  # If you are using GKE and want to manually setup a secret do the following:
  # kubectl -nkf create secret docker-registry knative-build-key \
  #   --docker-username=_json_key \
  #   --docker-server https://gcr.io \
  #   --docker-password="$(cat /path/to/key.json)"
