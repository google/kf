# Space

<!--
Enter an English description of the concept here and a rough explanation of how
it's mapped to the Kubernetes model.
-->
Cloud Foundry Spaces are mapped to Kubernetes Namespaces. The `kf` namespace is reserved.

`kf` will only treat Namespaces with the label `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=kf`
as Spaces for the purposes of executing webhooks and listing.

<!--
Populate this table with the action available on the Cloud controller in the
Action column and the Kubernetes verb and noun in the right hand column.

This table is useful for designing RBAC.
-->
| Action | `kf` Action |
|--------|-------------|
| Create | create namespace |
| Get | get namespace |
| List | list namespace |
| Update a space | update namespace |
| Get assigned isolation segment | _Not mapped_ |
| Manage isolation segment | _Not mapped_ |
