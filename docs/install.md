## Pre-requisites

This guide is intended to provide you with all the commands you'll
need to install `kf` in a single place. It assumes you have the
ability to run root containers in a cluster with at least 12 vCPUs
and 45G of memory and a minimum of three nodes.

You will also need to provide a docker compatible registry.

## Configure your Registry
In order to make this install simple to walk through we recommend you
store your docker registry details in an environment variable. This
install guide uses gcr on gke.

```
export KF_REGISTRY=gcr.io/<PROJECT_ID>
```

## Install Istio && Knative

Install istio CRDs and deploy pods and label the default namespace.
```
kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.5.0/istio-crds.yaml && \
kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.5.0/istio.yaml && \
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

Install Knative PODs
```
kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.5.0/serving.yaml \
--filename https://github.com/knative/build/releases/download/v0.5.0/build.yaml \
--filename https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/download/v0.5.0/release.yaml \
--filename https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/releases/download/v0.5.0/eventing-sources.yaml \
--filename https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.5.0/monitoring.yaml \
--filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knative/serving/v0.5.0/third_party/config/build/clusterrole.yaml
```

## Upload buildpacks
Buildpacks are provided by the operator and can be uploaded to Knative using the
CLI. A set of buidpacks is included in this repo. Change into the `samples/buildpacks`
directory and run the following command.
```
kf upload-buildpacks --container-registry $KF_REGISTRY
```

## Push your first app
At this point you are ready to deploy your first app using `kf`. Run the following command
to push your first app.
```
kf push helloworld --container-registry $KF_REGISTRY
```

## Install the service catalog
You can install the service catalog from the third_party directory included
in this repo.
```
kubectl apply -R -f third_party/service-catalog/manifests/catalog/templates
```

You should be able to see an empty marketplace at this point by running.
```
kf marketplace
```

## Install a service broker
Once you have the service catalog you'll want to install a service
broker. This example uses a broker called "mini-broker" which will
deploy services as helm charts locally in your cluster.

Configure helm in your cluster
```
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace kube-system tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule \
--clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account tiller
```

Add the chart and install
```
helm repo add minibroker https://minibroker.blob.core.windows.net/charts
helm install --name minibroker --namespace minibroker minibroker/minibroker
```
