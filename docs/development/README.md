# Development Docs

These `kf` platform documents are for developers and users who want to know more
about how `kf` works under the hood to demystify it.

Each document should contain a theory section to explain the topic and an
implementation section about how `kf` handles it and real world caveats.

If you're writing one of these documents, the theory section should be
[immutable documentation](https://codeascraft.com/2018/10/10/etsys-experiment-with-immutable-documentation/).
The theory and background should not change even if the implementation does.
