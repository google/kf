title:  Configure routes and domains
description: "Make your app reachable over the network."
---

This page describes how routes and domains work in Kf, and how developers and administrators configure routes and domains for an App deployed on Kf cluster.

You must create domain and routes to give external access to your application.

## Internal routing

Kf apps can communicate internally with other apps in the cluster directly using a service mesh without leaving the cluster network. By default, all traffic on the service mesh is encrypted using mutual TLS.

All apps deployed in the Kf cluster come with an internal endpoint configured by default. You can use the address <code><var>app-name</var>.<var>space-name</var>.svc.cluster.local</code> for internal communication between apps. To use this internal address no extra steps are required. Mutual TLS is enabled by default for internal routes. Note that this internal address is only accessible from the pods running the apps and not accessible from outside the cluster.

### App load balancing

Traffic is routed by Istio to healthy instances of an App using a
[round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS)
policy. Currently, this policy can't be changed.


## Route capabilities

Routes tell the cluster's ingress gateway where to deliver traffic and what to
do if no Apps are available on the given address.
By default, if no App is available on a Route and the Route receives a request
it returns an [HTTP 503 status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503).

Routes are comprised of three parts: host, domain, and path. For example, in
the URI `payroll.mydatacenter.example.com/login`:

* The host is `payroll`
* The domain is `mydatacenter.example.com`
* The path is `/login`

Routes _must_ contain a domain, but the host and path is optional. Multiple
Routes can share the same host and domain if they specify different paths.
Multiple Apps can share the same Route and traffic will be split between them.
This is useful if you need to support legacy blue/green deployments. If
multiple Apps are bound to different paths, the priority is longest to
shortest path.

Warning: Kf doesn't currently support TCP port-based routing. You must use a
[Kubernetes LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/)
if you want to expose a TCP port to the Internet. Ports are available on the cluster internal App address `<app-name>.<space>`.


## Manage routes

The following sections describe how to use the `kf` CLI to manage Routes.

### List routes

Developers can list Routes for the current Space using the `kf routes`
command.

```.sh
$ kf routes
Getting Routes in Space: my-space
Found 2 Routes in Space my-space

HOST    DOMAIN       PATH    APPS
echo    example.com  /       echo
*       example.com  /login  uaa
```

### Create a route

Developers can create Routes using the `kf create-route` command.

```.sh
# Create a Route in the targeted Space to match traffic for myapp.example.com/*
$ kf create-route example.com --hostname myapp

# Create a Route in the Space myspace to match traffic for myapp.example.com/*
$ kf create-route -n myspace example.com --hostname myapp

# Create a Route in the targeted Space to match traffic for myapp.example.com/mypath*
$ kf create-route example.com --hostname myapp --path /mypath

# You can also supply the Space name as the first parameter if you have
# scripts that rely on the old cf style API.
$ kf create-route myspace example.com --hostname myapp # myapp.example.com
```

After a Route is created, if no Apps are bound to it then an [HTTP 503 status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503)
is returned for any matching requests.

{{< note >}} Routes that share the same host and domain must be in the same Space.{{< /note >}}

### Map a route to your app

Developers can make their App accessible on a Route using the `kf map-route`
command.

```.sh
$ kf map-route MYAPP mycluster.example.com --host myapp --path mypath
```

{{< note >}} `map-route` creates the Route if it doesn't exist yet.{{< /note >}}

### Unmap a route

Developers can remove their App from being accessible on a Route using the `kf
unmap-route` command.

```.sh
$ kf unmap-route MYAPP mycluster.example.com --host myapp --path mypath
```

### Delete a route

Developers can delete a Route using the `kf delete-route` command.

```.sh
$ kf delete-route mycluster.example.com --host myapp --path mypath
```

Deleting a Route will stop traffic from being routed to all Apps listening on
the Route.

### Manage routes declaratively in your app manifest

Routes can be managed declaratively in your app manifest file. They will be
created if they do not yet exist.

```.yaml
---
applications:
- name: my-app
  # ...
  routes:
  - route: example.com
  - route: www.example.com/path
```

You can read more about the supported
route properties in the [manifest documentation](manifest).

{{< note >}} Declaring Routes in your manifest file only creates new Routes, it
does not delete Routes you created manually or as part of a previous push.{{< /note >}}


## Routing CRDs

There are four types that are relevant to routing:

* VirtualService
* Route
* Service
* App

Each App has a Service, which is an abstract name given to all running instances
of your App. The name of the Service is the same as the App. A Route represents
a single external URL. Routes constantly watch for changes to Apps, when an App
requests to be added to a Route, the Route updates its list of Apps and then the
VirtualService. A VirtualService represents a single domain and merges a list of
all Routes in a Space that belong to that domain.

Istio reads the configuration on VirtualServices to determine how to route
traffic.
