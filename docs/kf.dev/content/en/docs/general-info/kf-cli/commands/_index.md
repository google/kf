## kf

A MicroPaaS for Kubernetes with a Cloud Foundry style developer expeience

### Synopsis

Kf is a MicroPaaS for Kubernetes with a Cloud Foundry style developer expeience.

 Kf aims to be fully compatible with Cloud Foundry applications and lifecycle. It supports logs, buildpacks, app manifests, routing, service brokers, and injected services.

 At the same time, it aims to improve the operational experience by supporting git-ops, self-healing infrastructure, containers, a service mesh, autoscaling, scale-to-zero, improved quota management and does it all on Kubernetes using industry-standard OSS tools including Knative, Istio, and Tekton.
