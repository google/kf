If the affinity requirements specified by this field cease to be met at some point during pod execution (e.g. due to a pod label update), the system may or may not try to eventually evict the pod from its node. When there are multiple elements, the lists of nodes corresponding to each podAffinityTerm are intersected, i.e. all terms must be satisfied.

Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). \n An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed.

Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. \n This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created. \n Required, must not be nil."
